# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version: 2.5.5

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation
```shell
rails db:migratoin
```

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite
```shell
rails spec
```

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
```shell
rails serve -b localhost
```
** note: understand why the server needs to be explicitely bound to localhost... **

* ...
